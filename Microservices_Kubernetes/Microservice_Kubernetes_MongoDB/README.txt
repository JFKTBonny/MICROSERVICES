This guide demonstrates deploying a Dockerized Product Web and Product Server microservices stack on Kubernetes with MongoDB... 
Using Minikube, the architecture includes a StatefulSet for MongoDB with a persistent volume, ensuring data is retained across pod restarts... 
The frontend (Product Web) communicates with the backend (Product Server), which in turn persists product data in MongoDB... 
The setup supports full CRUD operations, and logs can be monitored via kubectl, while data persistence is verified directly on the mounted volume...

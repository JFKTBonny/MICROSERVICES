This example demonstrates a classic Docker "Links" setup to connect microservices with MongoDB. 

Key takeaways:

    Service linking:
             ProductWeb → ProductServer → MongoDB uses Docker links, allowing containers to communicate via internal hostnames (--link), 
             which is simpler but less flexible than custom networks...

    Build & deployment automation: 
            package-build-deploy.sh builds and packages both microservices, creates images, 
            and launches all containers in one step—streamlining the workflow...

    Logs for verification: 
             Following logs for both ProductServer and ProductWeb confirms successful initialization, data setup, and service availability...

    Testing the microservice: 
             Accessible via Minikube IP (http://$(minikube ip)8080/product.html), 
             showing that the frontend correctly interacts with the backend and database...

    Environment cleanup: 
              cleanup.sh efficiently removes all containers, images, and links, ensuring repeatable deployments.

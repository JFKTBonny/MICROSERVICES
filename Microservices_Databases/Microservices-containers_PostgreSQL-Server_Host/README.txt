This setup demonstrates a full-stack microservices architecture using Docker with a locally running PostgreSQL database... 
The Product Web frontend communicates with the Product Server backend via REST, which performs CRUD operations on the PostgreSQL database... 
The configuration includes allowing PostgreSQL to accept connections from the local network and Docker containers, 
building and running the services through Minikube, and cleaning up the environment after testing... 
This provides a practical example of microservices development and local integration testing with persistent data storage...

Microservices setup with Docker: Product Web → Product Server → PostgreSQL, full CRUD, local network access, and cleanup via Minikube.

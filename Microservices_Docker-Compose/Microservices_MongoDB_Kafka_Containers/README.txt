This setup demonstrates a complete microservices architecture running in Docker, 
where the frontend (product-web) communicates with the backend service (product-server) via Kafka messaging, 
and the backend persists data in MongoDB... 
The architecture is fully containerized, supports full CRUD operations, and can be quickly built, run, 
tested via a browser, and cleaned up using simple shell scripts...

A hands-on example of containerized microservices with messaging and database integration, all runnable in one go.

This example illustrates a containerized microservices setup using PostgreSQL as the backend database. 
The architecture consists of a frontend (product-web) communicating via REST with a backend service (product-server),
 which performs full CRUD operations on a PostgreSQL database... 
All components run in Docker, can be quickly built and launched together, tested via a browser, and cleanly removed...


A fully Dockerized microservices stack with PostgreSQL persistence, demonstrating end-to-end CRUD operations in a simple, reproducible environment.
